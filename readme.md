### Python WebSockets (v0.1) ###

A websockets server written in python, the idea is the interact with the very criptic web sockets API from a browser. This will allow me to work with leading techonology while working in a familiar language

+ Create way to unmask incoming messages
+ Restack message and mask over again

That process could take some time as for some reason preping data for websockets is very extensive. I should hopefully have it figured out soon.
